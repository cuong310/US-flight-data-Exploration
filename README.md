# US-flight-data-Exploration

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we delve into a comprehensive dataset containing information about flights within the United States from 1980 to 2009.

The dataset comprises millions of records collected over the period, sourced from reliable aviation databases and government agencies. It encompasses information on domestic flights operated by numerous airlines across various routes within the United States. Key variables include flight dates, departure and arrival times, carrier details, origin and destination airports, flight durations, delays (if any), cancellations, and reasons for disruptions.

This notebook using R to execute EDA and demo a random forest model for data in 2005 and 2006 to predict the rate of whether a flight would be cancelled or not in both Python and R to compare the performance of supporting machine learning of 2 programming languages.

The EDA includes visualizing data and finding patterns through these visualizations using ggplot and ggplot2 in R.
